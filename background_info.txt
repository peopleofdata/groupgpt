After the big success of the previous Hack4SmartServices hackathons we are very excited to organize a new edition.

About the hackathon

We are excited to announce an upcoming hackathon with the theme Society of the Future, and we want you to be a part of it! This hackathon presents an incredible opportunity to collaborate with other talented individuals and work towards creating innovative solutions that can shape a better future for us all.

During the hackathon you will tackle one of the challenges, using technology. In a small team of 4-6 people, you come up with a solution and work out a proof-of-concept and business plan. Throughout the weekend coaches will help you with different aspects: how to use smart technology, set up experiments, analyze data and build algorithms, write software, make a business case and pitch your idea.  

By joining us for this hackathon, you'll be part of a community that is dedicated to using technology for good and making a difference in the world.
